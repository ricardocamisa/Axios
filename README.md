# Axios Class for VBA
The Axios class is a VBA project that allows you to make HTTP requests with an easy-to-use interface similar to the Axios library in JavaScript. It provides methods for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH requests and allows you to configure headers, data, and URLs.

## Installation
